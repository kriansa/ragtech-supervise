# Ragtech Supervise Docker Image

Ragtech is a Brazilian company that produces UPS (more commonly known as no-break) devices. They
have a software called Supervise that is used to monitor and control the UPS devices.

The existing Supervise software packaging is not compatible with modern Linux distributions. This
project aims to provide a Docker image with Supervise supplying all required dependencies.

## Usage

You can run a new container from the computer where the UPS USB cable is plugged to. Validate that
the serial interface created by this USB is named `/dev/ttyACM0` and replace it accordingly:

```
$ docker run -d --name supervise --device /dev/ttyACM0:rw -p 4470:4470 ghcr.io/kriansa/ragtech-supervise:latest
```

## Logging

All log output is written to stdout and stderr. Logs are categorized with four different prefixes:
  - `main`: Logs referring to the stderr/stdout of the main `supsvc` process
  - `supsvc`: Logs related to the main supervise functionality
  - `device-manager`: Unknown, but I assume it's related to the communication with the UPS'es
  - `serialhid`: Logs related to the Serial interface to the UPS

## Interface

If you want to access the web interface, head to `http://localhost:4470` in your browser.

Alternatively, you can have programatic access to the UPS data connecting to the underlying SQLite
database used to store the logged information. It's really useful if you want, for instance, to
create a metrics exporter out of the UPS data. 

**IMPORTANT:** The SQLite database is set to use `WAL` as the journaling mode, so you can read the
database while it's being written to. Because of that, you need to also account for all the database
files:
  - /data/monit.db
  - /data/monit.db-wal
  - /data/monit.db-shm

This is how you would run the container with the database mounted to the host filesystem:

```
$ mkdir host-db-path
$ docker run [...] -v ./host-db-path:/data ghcr.io/kriansa/ragtech-supervise:latest
```
